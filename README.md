# R4Z0R#1111

I am R4Z0R, and I am a beginner White Hat Hacker, and I have been a web Developer and Designer for several years! My main Goal is to create tools to help other people,
to be safe on the internet. Or to defend themselves from malware, learn more about Cyber Defense, and useful tools for White Hat Hackers.

>Note: I am still a beginner, so my tools are not perfect, or the safest in any way! I do most of them for practise, and learn alot along the way! But I always want to get better at coding, to create more complex and helpful Projects in the future!

Currently these are the languages I can code in:

- [x] C
- [x] C#
- [x] Java
- [x] Javascript
- [x] HTML
- [x] CSS
- [x] GML
- [x] PHP 
- [x] PYTHON
